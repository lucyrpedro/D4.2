  abstract = {In this video from the PASC16 conference, Beth Wingate from the University of Exeter presents: Challenges for Climate and Weather Prediction in the Era of Heterogeneous Computer Architectures: Oscillatory Stiffness, Time-Parallelism, and the Slow Manifold.

"For weather or climate models to achieve exascale performance on next-generation heterogeneous computer architectures they will be required to exploit on the order of million- or billion-way parallelism. This degree of parallelism far exceeds anything possible in today's models even though they are highly optimized. In this talk I will discuss the mathematical issue that leads to the limitations in space- and time-parallelism for climate and weather prediction models - oscillatory stiffness in the PDE. I will go on to discuss recent successful time-parallel algorithms including the fast-converging asymptotic parareal method and a time-parallel matrix exponential."
 
Short Biography
Beth Wingate is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Exeter. Previous to this she was a Senior Scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Her recent research is focused on dynamics in the Arctic Ocean, the slow/fast dynamics of the air-sea interface, and time-parallel methods for climate modeling intended to take advantage of increased parallelism available with heterogeneous computer architectures.

Presented: 12 August 2016.

Abstract: 
Clear trends in the past and current petascale systems (i.e., Jaguar and Titan) and the new generation of systems that will transition us toward exascale (i.e., Aurora and Summit) outline how concurrency and peak performance are growing dramatically, however, I/O bandwidth remains stagnant. Next-generation systems are expected to deliver 7 to 10 times higher peak floating-point performance with only 1 to 2 times higher PFS bandwidth compared to the current generation.

Data-intensive applications, especially those exhibiting bursty I/O, must take this aspect into consideration and be more selective about what data is written to disk and how the data is written. In addressing the needs of these applications, can we take advantage of a rapidly changing technology landscape, including containerised environments, burst buffers, and in-situ/in-transit analytics? Are these technologies ready to transition these applications to exascale? In general, existing software components managing these technologies are I/O-ignorant, resulting in systems running the data-intensive applications that exhibit contentions, hot spots, and poor performance. 

In this talk, we explore challenges when dealing with I/O-ignorant high performance computing systems and opportunities for integrating I/O awareness in these systems. Specifically, we present solutions that use I/O awareness to:

1. make informed decisions on applications' allocations in containerised environments
2. reduce contentions in scheduling policies managing under provisioned systems with burst buffers, and
3. mitigate data movements in data-intensive simulations.

Our proposed solutions go beyond high performance computing and develop opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations.},

"NASA's observations from Earth-orbiting satellites and outputs from computational climate models have contributed to one of the most data-intensive scientific disciplines today. The Earth system science tries to analyze the data, turns the data into information, makes sense of the information into knowledge and wisdom, utilize the knowledge and wisdom in decision making processes. In every step of the data life cycle workflow (i.e. curation, discovery, access, and analysis), NASA faces tremendous challenges.

 Many times we like to draw parallels the library science and the data science in our distributed environment. NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are the curator and steward of the data. A tradition workflow focuses on indexing the data for easy search and disseminate the data through a FTP or web server. This is very similar to a user searching out a publication and checking out a book at a library. Increasingly, this traditional workflow is no longer working in this digital age. When the data volume becomes large, interdisciplinary science becomes prevalent, multi-dimensional data analysis becomes necessary, our existing data management infrastructure and workflows have become inadequate. NASA not only has to provide archival, distribution, and stewardship of the data, but we also have to develop and share tools that simplify access and utilization of data, as well as address the large computational demands associated with the data utilization. New challenges have surfaced every day.

In this talk, I will give examples of these challenges and discuss the approach we have taken in meeting these challenges.  I will also discuss how the HPC community may help in facing some of the technical challenges with the hope to expand the business case for the HPC community."},

  abstract = {I/O is starting to dominate execution time and is becoming a limit to scalability for numerous HPC applications. The mean time between failures on future extreme scale machines is expected to decrease which will add more I/O pressure with reading and writing of checkpoints. Compression techniques can be employed to reduce data size before I/O operations. Compared to traditional lossless compression which yields only minor reductions in dataset size, lossy compression is able to deliver a 5-50x reduction in data set size, but at the expense of adding error into the data set. In this talk, we investigate the use of lossy compression when restarting from lossy compressed checkpoints in the applications PlascomCM and Nek5000. We highlight how simulation properties such as truncation error can help guide the selection of a compression error tolerance.},
