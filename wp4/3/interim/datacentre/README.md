Evolution of data centres in order to support climate research - report

What is here?

The overview.mm file is created and maintained with Freemind
(freemind.sf.net); for those without Freemind, a PNG is available.

Freemind tracks the outline of the report: the intention is to keep
the document structured essentially as the Freemind map (with parts,
sections, subsections, etc., cf Lamport 2.2.3).

Note that Freemind comes with an XSLT which creates LaTeX from
Freemind files.  However, it may be interesting to be able to update
the document, as opposed to regenerate it from scratch, as sections
are added (or moved) in the Freemind map.
