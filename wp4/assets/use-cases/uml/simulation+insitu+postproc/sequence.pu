User -> JobManager: submit job(IN, OUT)
JobManager -> Nodes

== Initialization ==

Nodes -> Storage: read IN=x
Storage -> Nodes: return

== Loop ==

Nodes -> Nodes: compute
activate Nodes

Nodes -> ESDM: write async OUT=y
activate ESDM
ESDM -> Storage: write snapshot (async)
ESDM -> libpost: trigger post processing if region effected


== In Situ Post Processing ==
libpost -> libpost: perform post processing
libpost -> Storage: (could write result directly)
ESDM <- libpost: return
ESDM -> Storage: write post processing result
ESDM -> Nodes: return

deactivate ESDM

Storage -> User: OUT files become visible

...multiple iterations...

== Finalize ==

Storage -> User: All OUT files become visible to subsequent users.
