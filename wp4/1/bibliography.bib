Information about the energy consumption of data not only allows to account for the correct costs of its life cycle, but also provides a feedback to the user and administrator, and improves awareness of the energy consumption of file I/O. Ideas to realize a storage landscape which determines the energy consumption for maintaining and accessing each file are discussed. We propose to add new extended attributes to file metadata which enable to compute the energy consumed during the life cycle of each file.},

"For weather or climate models to achieve exascale performance on next-generation heterogeneous computer architectures they will be required to exploit on the order of million- or billion-way parallelism. This degree of parallelism far exceeds anything possible in today's models even though they are highly optimized. In this talk I will discuss the mathematical issue that leads to the limitations in space- and time-parallelism for climate and weather prediction models - oscillatory stiffness in the PDE. I will go on to discuss recent successful time-parallel algorithms including the fast-converging asymptotic parareal method and a time-parallel matrix exponential."

Short Biography
Beth Wingate is a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Exeter. Previous to this she was a Senior Scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  Her recent research is focused on dynamics in the Arctic Ocean, the slow/fast dynamics of the air-sea interface, and time-parallel methods for climate modeling intended to take advantage of increased parallelism available with heterogeneous computer architectures.

Presented: 12 August 2016.

Abstract:
Clear trends in the past and current petascale systems (i.e., Jaguar and Titan) and the new generation of systems that will transition us toward exascale (i.e., Aurora and Summit) outline how concurrency and peak performance are growing dramatically, however, I/O bandwidth remains stagnant. Next-generation systems are expected to deliver 7 to 10 times higher peak floating-point performance with only 1 to 2 times higher PFS bandwidth compared to the current generation.

Data-intensive applications, especially those exhibiting bursty I/O, must take this aspect into consideration and be more selective about what data is written to disk and how the data is written. In addressing the needs of these applications, can we take advantage of a rapidly changing technology landscape, including containerised environments, burst buffers, and in-situ/in-transit analytics? Are these technologies ready to transition these applications to exascale? In general, existing software components managing these technologies are I/O-ignorant, resulting in systems running the data-intensive applications that exhibit contentions, hot spots, and poor performance.

In this talk, we explore challenges when dealing with I/O-ignorant high performance computing systems and opportunities for integrating I/O awareness in these systems. Specifically, we present solutions that use I/O awareness to:

1. make informed decisions on applications' allocations in containerised environments
2. reduce contentions in scheduling policies managing under provisioned systems with burst buffers, and
3. mitigate data movements in data-intensive simulations.

Our proposed solutions go beyond high performance computing and develop opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations.},

For each model, we sort the preprocessed code into components and subcomponents based on dependency structure. We then create software architecture diagrams that show the relative sizes of these components/subcomponents and the flow of data between them. The diagrams also illustrate several major classes of climate model design; the distribution of complexity between components, which depends on historical development paths as well as the conscious goals of each institution; and the sharing of components between different modeling groups. These diagrams offer insights into the similarities and differences in structure between climate models, and have the potential to be useful tools for communication between scientists, scientific institutions, and the public.},

"NASA's observations from Earth-orbiting satellites and outputs from computational climate models have contributed to one of the most data-intensive scientific disciplines today. The Earth system science tries to analyze the data, turns the data into information, makes sense of the information into knowledge and wisdom, utilize the knowledge and wisdom in decision making processes. In every step of the data life cycle workflow (i.e. curation, discovery, access, and analysis), NASA faces tremendous challenges.

 Many times we like to draw parallels the library science and the data science in our distributed environment. NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) are the curator and steward of the data. A tradition workflow focuses on indexing the data for easy search and disseminate the data through a FTP or web server. This is very similar to a user searching out a publication and checking out a book at a library. Increasingly, this traditional workflow is no longer working in this digital age. When the data volume becomes large, interdisciplinary science becomes prevalent, multi-dimensional data analysis becomes necessary, our existing data management infrastructure and workflows have become inadequate. NASA not only has to provide archival, distribution, and stewardship of the data, but we also have to develop and share tools that simplify access and utilization of data, as well as address the large computational demands associated with the data utilization. New challenges have surfaced every day.

In this talk, I will give examples of these challenges and discuss the approach we have taken in meeting these challenges.  I will also discuss how the HPC community may help in facing some of the technical challenges with the hope to expand the business case for the HPC community."},

  abstract = {I/O is starting to dominate execution time and is becoming a limit to scalability for numerous HPC applications. The mean time between failures on future extreme scale machines is expected to decrease which will add more I/O pressure with reading and writing of checkpoints. Compression techniques can be employed to reduce data size before I/O operations. Compared to traditional lossless compression which yields only minor reductions in dataset size, lossy compression is able to deliver a 5-50x reduction in data set size, but at the expense of adding error into the data set. In this talk, we investigate the use of lossy compression when restarting from lossy compressed checkpoints in the applications PlascomCM and Nek5000. We highlight how simulation properties such as truncation error can help guide the selection of a compression error tolerance.},

  abstract = {It is well known that load balancing and low delivery communication cost are two critical issues in mapping requests to servers in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). However, the trade-off between these two performance metrics has not been yet quantitatively investigated in designing efficient request mapping schemes. In this work, we formalize this trade-off through a stochastic optimization problem. While the solutions to the problem in the extreme cases of minimum communication cost and optimum load balancing can be derived in closed form, finding the general solution is hard to derive. Thus we propose three heuristic mapping schemes and compare the trade-off performance of them through extensive simulations. Our simulation results show that at the expense of high query cost, we can achieve a good trade-off curve. Moreover, by benefiting from the power of multiple choices phenomenon, we can achieve almost the same performance with much less query cost. Finally, we can handle requests with different delay requirements at the cost of degrading network performance.},

  title = {Capacity of {{Clustered Distributed Storage}}},
  abstract = {A new system model reflecting the clustered structure of distributed storage is suggested to investigate bandwidth requirements for repairing failed storage nodes. Large data centers with multiple racks/disks or local networks of storage devices (e.g. sensor network) are good applications of the suggested clustered model. In realistic scenarios involving clustered storage structures, repairing storage nodes using intact nodes residing in other clusters is more bandwidth-consuming than restoring nodes based on information from intra-cluster nodes. Therefore, it is important to differentiate between intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth in modeling distributed storage. Capacity of the suggested model is obtained as a function of fundamental resources of distributed storage systems, namely, storage capacity, intra-cluster repair bandwidth and cross-cluster repair bandwidth. Based on the capacity expression, feasible sets of required resources which enable reliable storage are analyzed. It is shown that the cross-cluster traffic can be minimized to zero (i.e., intra-cluster local repair becomes possible) by allowing extra resources on storage capacity and intra-cluster repair bandwidth, according to a law specified in a closed-form. Moreover, trade-off between cross-cluster traffic and intra-cluster traffic is observed for sufficiently large storage capacity.},
